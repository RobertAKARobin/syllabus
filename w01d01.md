# GA 101

## Roles

### You do:
On post-its, write down specific action items and measurables that answer the following questions. Then stick the post-its to the board.

- What is the role of the student?

### I do:

- What is the role of the instructor?
- What is the product that will be delivered by GA to the student?

## The WDI Instructors Creed

- What does it mean to be in a "boot camp"?
  - You will be asked to do things you don't necessarily agree with.
    - As in, teaching methods
  - You will be asked to do things that are uncomfortable.
    - This is part of growth.
  - We will not give up on you, even when you have given up on yourself.
  - You can't "win".
    - This is a noncompetitive environment. 
  - You will be re-learning how to learn.
  - You will have to learn to motivate yourself.
  - Ultimately, **you have to trust the system.**
    - Trust that we have your best interests at heart
    - Trust that our decisions are informed by solid experience

Note that none of the above mention anything about code.

## What to expect?

- For many students, this is the hardest thing they've ever done in their lives.
  - This is the first time they've been bad at something.
  - You can't BS your way through code.
    - The fundamental standard: It either works, or it doesn't. No amount of sweet-talking will make it work.
- Memorizing stuff won't help you.
  - Programming is a mindset. It's about confidence. It's about being able to say, "Eh, I'm going to try this thing, even though I don't really understand it, and I'm not going to get attached to it in case it doesn't work and I have to erase all my code and try something completely different."
- Ask for help.
  - This is the thing students find the hardest, and the thing that ultimately determines whether or not they will be successful in this class.
  - Without fail, the students who do not ask for help do the poorest in the class.

## What is asking for help?

- Asking a clear problem. "I don't know any of this" isn't a clear problem. "I tried this thing and got this error" is a clear problem.

## Hard Requirements

The only requirements are for qualifying for Outcomes. As long as you do not create an environment that precludes others from learning, nothing will preclude you from being able to attend class.

### What does it mean for a student to qualify for Outcomes?
- They have the highest career-placement priority with Outcomes.
- They may present at the Meet and Hire.

### To qualify for Outcomes:

- Between **W01D01 and W05D05 8:59AM**, and again between **W07D01 and W11D05 8:59AM**:
  - Have been absent no more than 2 days
  - Have been tardy no more than 6 days
  - Have completed 80% of homework
- Additionally, earn no more than 1 "does not meet expectations" on Projects 1-3.
  - What about Project 4?
    - That's "your project". It marks the transition between us starting to make you a good developer, and you having to take yourself the rest of the way through your career.

### To clarify
- What are "absent" and "tardy"?
  - There is no excused **anything**. This is why we give you 4 days to be absent and 12 days to be tardy.
- What is "complete"?
  - You made a clear effort to solve the homework yourself. If you pulled code from somewhere, you annotated your code saying where you pulled it from. No plagiarism. We can tell.
- What is "does not meet expectations"?
  - Each project will have a rubric.

## Structure

- One-on-ones
  - Each student will be scheduled one half-hour slot every two weeks during which they will meet with an instructor.
  - Talk about whatever needs to be talked about
  - Should you need additional meetings with instructors, just ask!
- Office Hours
  - Led exclusively by TAs
  - Usually 4 nights a week, until 7:30
- Instructor Communication
  - Instructors **may not** respond to code questions on Slack nor in-person after 6pm each night, even if we're in the office
  - Should you have a logistical question, you may contact the **Student Communication Instructor**
  - All code questions should go to TAs
  - **You do:** *Why are we so restrictive about this?*
- Homework and assessments
  - Most homework will be checked only for **completeness** -- that is, that you actually attempted it yourself and didn't copy code. If you want more feedback, you'll need to ask for it.
  - There will be one homework per week that is graded for **comprehension**.
- Classes
  - Alphabetical by last name. Will be reshuffled after every project.

- 9-10 Warmup
- 10:12:30 Lesson

- 4-5 Homework assigned, warm-down
